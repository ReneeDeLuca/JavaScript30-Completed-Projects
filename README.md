# Javascript30 Completed Projects
Following Wes Bos's Javascript30 Course

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

I'm using this course to expand my knowledge on vanilla JS. Bos's approach is to use 10-20 minute projects every day for 30 days as a way to build on one's previous JS knowledge base and continually add new skills thoughout the month.
